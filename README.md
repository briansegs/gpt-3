## About the app:
I wanted to learn how to transform a Figma design into a fully functioning website, improve my CSS skills, and create a modern and responsive React.js website so I built this website. I learn best by first studying the material and then doing a few projects to work out what I learned. 

### The skills I learned after completing this project:
- React functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental CSS properties to improve my flex & grid skills
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- Animations and gradients
- Media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost all devices

## Technologies:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup:
Clone the project and enter its root directory.

Install **Node.js** -> [Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)

### `npm i`
Installs all of the project's dependencies.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Approach:
After finding the design I created a basic React app and set up the file structure. Next, I added some basic styles to my CSS file that I knew I would be resuing. After that, I built each section in the order that they appear on the website, tweaking their responsiveness as I went. Lastly, I deploy the site to Github pages. 

## Status:
This project is finished.
